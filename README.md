# save-the-planet-with-rust

One can write a software that does a particular job in different languages: Python, Go, Javascript, Rust... you name it. The choice matters. The efficiency of the software at runtime affects the planet. 

The less system resources the software utilize on runtime the better:

* more computations can be handled by single unit of hardware,
* less units of hardware are needed to scale,
* less electricity is used,
* smaller demand for hardware saves world resources (metal, semiconductors)

This project demonstrates how Rust compares to other popular languages.

This project proves that Rust saves the planet.
